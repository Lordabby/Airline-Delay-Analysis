# Project Name: Airline Delay Analysis

This project is used to demonstrate skills and knowledge gained through the course of #NG30DAYS OF LEARNING.
----
Problem Objectives:
1. What has been the history of flight experiences in the past?
2. How bad was delayed flights?
3. Any identified pattern with delayed flights?
4. Any possible recommendation?

# Data Sourcing;
The data used for this project was obtained on Github, check the link below; 
https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/blob/main/Airline%20Project/Airlines.csv

# Data Preparation
The dataset was converted into. XLSX format was stored in a secure worksheet.

# Data Preparation
i. Data formatting
ii. Data Trimming
iii. Fixing data type and typecasting.
iv. Removing incomplete data which include four rows.

# Data Visualization
The dataset was visualised using Power Bi software.

# Reports;
i.A total flight record of 539,380 was made available of which 299,120 was a good experience and 240,260 was a Bad experience, constituting 44.54% of the total flight.

ii. Flight (aircraft) 16 has the highest delayed cases with value of 216. Followed byaircraft 9, 371,5,28, 8, 511, 55, 62, 12 with delayed cases of 192, 190, 190, 175, 160, 158,149, 139 and 135 respectively.

ii. Considering Days of the week, Tuesday has the highest delayed cases of 42,254 cases, followed by Wednesday (41244), Thursday (35515), Sunday (34,030), and Monday (31,913), Saturday (31692) and Friday (23615).

ii. From the airlines available, the top five airlines with high delayed cases are;
 WN has the highest delayed cases of 65,657 (27.33%), then DL with a value of 27,452 (11.43%), OO with the value of 22760 (9.50%), AA with a value of 17,736 (7.40%) and MQ with the value of 12,742 (5.30%).

iv. From the length travelled, the highest case was recorded when the length was 70.

v. From time travelled, the highest delayed cases were recorded at 360 min.


Recommendation:
1.Tuesday trip/flight should be rescheduled to Friday, Saturday or Monday.

2. Airlines such as HA, F9, YV, OH, and AS  should be used for possible trips.


3. flight (Aircraft) especially 16,9, 371, 5, 28, 8, 511, 55, 62, and 12 should be avoided.
